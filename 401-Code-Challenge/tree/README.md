# Tree 

Create a Node class

* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

Create a BinaryTree class

* Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately. Also add findMaximumValue(arr) which find the maximum value in an array returned by the previous methods. Add a breadthFirst method which should return an array representing a level order traversal.

Create a BinarySearchTree class

* Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
* Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.


## Challenge
**BinaryTree should have these five different methods:**

.preOrder() ()
Input: the binary tree the method is called on
Output: array of values using preOrder sort

.inOrder() ()
Input: the binary tree the method is called on
Output: array of values using preOrder sort

.postOrder() ()
Input: the binary tree the method is called on
Output: array of values using inOrder sort

.findMaximumValue(arr) (takes in an array returned by one of the methods above)
Input: an array returned by preOrder(), inOrder() or postOrder()
Output: an integer with the maximum value found in the tree

.breadthFirst() ()
Input: the binary tree the method is called on
Output: array of values using breadth first, level order sort

**BinarySearchTree should have these two different methods:**

.add(value) (adds a node with value to the binary search tree)
Input: a value object to add to the binary tree at the proper location
Output: none

.contains(value) (searches for a value in the binary search tree)
Input: a value to search for in the tree
Output: a boolean representing whether or not the value is in the tree

## Approach & Efficiency

**Big O Notation**

Binary search tree insertion and search is a worst case of O(log n) on a balanced tree, or on an unbalanced tree it is O(height). Space should be Big O(1) for search. For methods that show a representation of the tree the Big O time varies from O(1) to O(height^2).
